# SentimentAnalysis

Project is created to, firstly, get stock prices data from Yahoo!Finance API for top 30 German companies in term of market capitalisation. Secondly, it scrapes news headlines of three companies including SAP, BioNTech and Deutsche Bank from FinViz website. There are sentiment classifiers used to assign sentiment labels, and scores based on the headlines' analyis. Then the prices data is combined with sentiment classifications to examine the relationship between them.
